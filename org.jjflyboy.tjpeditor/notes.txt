Repeating attributes: The TJIII interpretor supports repeating attributes.  The editor
does not have to.  It can restrict only one of each attribute, or allow repeating attributes.
Currently, the editor is implemented to allow repeating attributes.

CellText: TJIII doc is ambiguous: assuming: celltext <rich text> <logical expression>
